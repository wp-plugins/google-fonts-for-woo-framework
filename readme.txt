Give the WooThemes framework access to the full range of current Google Webfonts.

== Description ==

The purpose of this plugin is to make all available Google webfonts available to the WooThemes Canvas theme, and any other themes that use the WooThemes framework.

It works like this:

1. You register for a Google API key, and make sure it is enabled for web fonts. Set the API key in the plugin settings menu.
2. The key is used to download the full list of Google web fonts. This is cached locally, every twelve hours at present.
3. The full list of fonts is merged into the list that the Woo framework already knows about.

What you should then see, is the ability to select any available Google web font in the WooThemes theme administration pages, and have those fonts displayed in your theme.

Register for a Google API key, and turn on "webfonts" for the key here:
